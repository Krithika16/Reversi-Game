# Reversi-Game
This is the repository for my Reversi game - Bioeng, Year 2 Programming II assignment 1.
Reversi is a board game for two players. There are game pieces called disks, labelled ‘O’ or ‘X’. Players take turns placing disks on the board. If a player places his or her disk next to an opponent’s disk and if there is a player’s disk on the other side of the opponent’s disk, the opponent’s disks between the player’s disks will be flipped. The object of the game is to have the most disks on the board when the last playable empty square is filled.
